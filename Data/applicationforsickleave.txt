Subject: Application for Sick Leave

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend work for the next few days due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell and after consulting with my doctor, I was advised to take a few days off to rest and recover.

I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause and I will do my best to ensure that my work is up to date before I leave. I will also make arrangements for a colleague to cover any urgent tasks that may come up during my absence.

I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know as soon as I am able to return to work. In the meantime, please let me know if there is anything else I can do to make this transition smoother.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
